                    love for music. <br><br>Fugazi just keep coming back as favourites! That goes for
                    listening as well as for inspiration on the bass or just music making in general. 
                    They're the ultimate weavers of music in my soundscape. <br>Victor Wooten. Well, 
                    he's the guy that was born with a bass in his hands, practically. And he knows music, 
                    just like me aul' mate Cedric. Cheers boss for your patience!       </p>

                <h2>The wider world. Home and Away</h2>
                <p>I grew up in the country, so I was at least always aware of the nature around me, 
                   and special thanks to my mam, she made a point of imlicitly teaching about it.
                   I'm not sure if I can attribute that to getting into the environmental movement.
                   <br><br>Dr. Vandana Shiva and Eva Dassen are two influencers that spring to mind. 
                   Greta of course as well!     </p>

                    I'm proud to be a part of. It's not an easy ride though. There is much work to do. 
                    I'm happy to be able to improvise aspects of my life to
                    in  striving for the goals of XR.

                    I feel good about being part of the BarNBoos jam session crew. It's rewarding to 
                    feel like a part of something that doesn't have strong commitment demands, but that is
                    +++++present to offer a public good. And they're all super cool folks. What's not to love.</p>
