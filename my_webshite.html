                <p class="para">They say that if there's one thing that's sure in this universe
                it's change. If there's one thing that hasn't changed about me, it's got to be my love for music.
            <br><br>Fugazi and AC/DC just keep coming back as favourites! That goes for listening as well as for
             inspiration on the bass or just music making in general. Victor Wooten. Well, he's the guy that was 
             born with a bass in his hands. And he knows music, just like Cedric!       </p>

                <h2>The wider world. Home and Away</h2>
                <p>I grew up in the country, so I was at least always aware of nature, and special thanks
                    to my mam, she made a point of imlicitly teaching about it.
                I'm not sure if I can attribute that to getting into the environmental movement.<br><br>
            Dr. Vandana Shiva and Eva Dassen are two influencers that spring to mind. Greta of course as well!     </p>

                <p><span><a src="https://rebellion.global/">XR</span> Extinction Rebellion is something I'm proud to be a part of.
                     It's not an easy ride though.  
                    <br><br>
                    I feel good about being part of the BarNBoos jam session crew. It's rewarding to 
                    feel like a part of something that doesn't have strong commitment demands, but that is
                present to offer a public good. And they're all super cool folks. What's not to love.</p>
