webshites for gobshites

**Q**. What is the actual purpose of this exercise? 

**A**. Just to get some initial practice while learning HTML and CSS, and also to get a bit more fluent with Git and Github. Hopefully I'll be adding some Javascript in the not too distant future to get it a bit more responsive. And ho ho ho, a couple of Solidity smart contracts perhaps! 
But let's build our blocks out with awareness as to how everything fits together and relates to each other. I can expect a few glitches on the way - that's  allowed :)

**Q**. What is going to be on this webshite, Mish Mon?

**A**. Pretty random actually. A few of my interests, passions, projects and a way to
contact me and the projects and also donate crypto to those projects.

**My passions and interests**:

_Gateway to and from the soul_:

1. my favourite bands
2. influencers for me in music

The wider world. 
_Home and away_

3. my environmental views
4. influencers on societal matters and environmental

Organisations I'm affiliated with
Who's pullin' them strings then?_

5. music
6. socio-environment


**Workflow**:
**HTML**

Elements to start with:
html
head 
title  
body
h1
nav ul li
sections with id and article with h2 and p els
figure with img and figcaption tags
ol li for fav bands and NGOs
footer for communication and MM link
close body tags
html

start simple with a short subjective article 
on each of the six points

**CSS** 

Just going to start freestyling as I build out the HTML and see if I can get a feel for what's 
necessary to have in the HTML code qua styling (e.g. creating tables for certain elements) or 
what should or could be better in the CSS code file (e.g. styling the elements themselves as opposed  
to creating unnecessary HTML code)
