** Workflow CSS** 

Just going to start freestyling as I build out the HTML and see if I can get a feel for what's 
necessary to have in the HTML code qua styling (e.g. creating tables for certain elements) or 
what should or could be better in the CSS code file (e.g. styling the elements themselves as opposed  
to creating unnecessary HTML code)
